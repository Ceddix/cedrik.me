# About Me

Hey there! I'm Cedrik, an {new Date(Date.now() - new Date("2005-10-22").getTime()).getUTCFullYear() - 1970} years old student from Belgium, living near the borders of Germany and the Netherlands. Currently, I study International Business at [Maastricht University](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/) (NL).

## What I Do
Since I was a kid, I always wanted to discover all sorts of things, get to know as much as possible and let my creativity run wild. When I discovered Minecraft, I was hooked. However, I didn't play survival or PvP like most people. I was more interested in developing complicated redstone and command block mechanisms.

Later I got curious about Minecraft servers and soon enough, I was learning script languages and built some overcomplicated commands. Eventually, I landed on the server I'm part of today – CraftTogetherMC – where I take care of the mechanics for various events. Most of these consist of large command block chains. I'm also responsible for our rail network, which runs throughout the whole freebuild world.

I have been managing the server together with [@Lillitha](https://discord.com/users/296954822702399488) for some time now and made sure that the server runs and is always up2date. The main goal of CraftTogetherMC is to create a (German-speaking) community where you can play with others without destroying the Minecraft vanilla feeling too much. We have open freebuild worlds without claiming restrictions, money system, but with nice and active community in all ages.

If you want to find out more about CraftTogetherMC, you can explore our worlds at our [Livemap](https://craft-together-mc.de/map) or join our community on [Discord](https://craft-together-mc.de/discord).

## Other Projects
Oh, and here's a bit more about me. I started learning programming a few years ago. I'm mostly self-taught, relying on the internet and other open-source projects to pick up various programming languages. Here's a list of some of the things I did:
