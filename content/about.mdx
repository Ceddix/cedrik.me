# About Me

Hey there! I'm Cedrik, an {new Date(Date.now() - new Date("2005-10-22").getTime()).getUTCFullYear() - 1970} years old student from Belgium, living near the borders of Germany and the Netherlands. Currently, I study International Business at [Maastricht University](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/) (NL). As part of my study program, I completed an exchange semester at [HEC Montréal](https://hec.ca) in Québec, Canada.

## What I Do
Since I was a kid, I always wanted to discover all sorts of things, get to know as much as possible and let my creativity run wild. On the one hand, this led me to my studies, as I wanted to learn how companies and our economy in general work. On the other hand, however, this has always played a major role in my free time as well.

When I discovered Minecraft, I was hooked. However, I was mostly interested in developing complicated redstone and command block mechanisms. Later I got curious about Minecraft servers and soon enough, I landed on the server I'm part of today – CraftTogetherMC – where I take care of the mechanics for various events. Most of these consist of large command block chains. I'm also responsible for our rail network, which runs throughout the whole freebuild world.

I have been managing the server together with [@Lillitha](https://discord.com/users/296954822702399488) for some time now and made sure that the server runs and is always up2date. Our main goal is to create a (German-speaking) community where everyone can feel safe, without destroying the Minecraft Vanilla feeling too much.

## Projects
Oh, and here's a bit more about me. I started learning programming a few years ago. I'm mostly self-taught, relying on the internet and other open-source projects to pick up various programming languages. This website for example, is my first NextJS project. Here's a list of some other things I did:
