# About Me

Hey there! I'm Cedrik, an {new Date(Date.now() - new Date("2005-10-22").getTime()).getUTCFullYear() - 1970} years old student from Belgium, living near the borders of Germany and the Netherlands. Currently, I study International Business at [Maastricht University](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/) (NL).

## What I Do
Since I was a kid, I always wanted to discover all sorts of things, get to know as much as possible and let my creativity run wild. When I discovered Minecraft, I was hooked. However, I didn't play survival or PvP like most people, but was more interested in developing complicated redstone and command block mechanisms.

Later I got curious about Minecraft servers and soon enough, I was learning script languages and built some overcomplicated commands. Eventually, I landed on the server I'm part of today – CraftTogetherMC. On CraftTogetherMC I take care of the mechanics for various events, most of which consist of command blocks. I'm also responsible for our rail network, which runs through the whole freebuild.

I have been managing the server together with [@Lillitha](https://discord.com/users/296954822702399488) for some time now and make sure that the server runs and is always up2date. The main concept of CraftTogetherMC is to offer our German-speaking community a server that feels almost vanilla. We have open freebuild worlds without claiming restrictions, money system, but with nice and active community in all ages.

## Other Projects
Oh, and here's a bit more about me. I started learning programming a few years ago, thanks to the original creator of CraftTogetherMC. I'm mostly self-taught, relying on the internet and other open-source projects to pick up various programming languages. Here's a list of some of the things I did:
